# A Rust programming introduction in 2 hours

The goal for this repo is to provide a basic introduction to the Rust programming language, tooling, resources, and community in 2 hours. The reader should be able to leverage this knowledge to further develop their Rust programming skills.

## Agenda

- [Setup your development environment](#setup-your-development-environment])
- [Introduction to the Rust programming language](#introduction-to-the-rust-programming-language)
- [Programming challenges](#programming-challenges)
- [Resources](#resources)

## Setup your development environment

This section will guide you through setting a development environment on [Ubuntu Desktop](#ubuntu-desktop), [Mac](#mac), or [Windows](#windows). If you don't want to setup an environment, there are [alternatives](#alternatives) to get you coding in Rust quickly.
### Ubuntu Desktop


> These instructions have were tested on Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

### Alternative

Do you just want to kick the tires in Rust witout setting up an environment? If so, try out the [Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/), where you can experiment with the language online without setting up an environment.

## Programming challenges

This sections contains tutorials and programming challenges.

- [Guessing game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
  - After completing the tutorial, try adding the following features to your application:
    - If the user guesses incorrectly, inform the user of their missed guess using a _red_ font. Also, consider sounding an abnoxious horn if the user guesses incorrectly.
    - If the user guesses correctly, inform the user of their success using a _green_ font. Also, consider sounding a pleasant bell chime if the user guess correctly.
    - Clear the terminal when the program starts so the user has a clean terminal to start from.
    - If the user guesses the same number twice, tell them to stop repeating themselves.

- [Area of a triangle](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-02-example-structs.html)
  - After completing the tutorial, try modifying your program to accept triangle dimensions from the user via console input. Don't forget to validate your input and handle any errors.
